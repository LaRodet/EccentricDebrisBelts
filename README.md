This repository gives the codes and data sets to reproduce the results of the article "Eccentric debris belts reveal the dynamical history of the companion exoplanet" by Laetitia Rodet & Dong Lai, 2022, submitted to MNRAS.

RandomGrowth.py creates a planet-planet scattering evolution and the consequence on an outer test particle. It was used to create Figure 5.

RandomGrowth_FreeEccentricity_Levi.py creates a sample of planet-planet scattering evolutions of different sizes following a Levi distribution. It is used to create the sample "RandomGrowth_FreeEccentricity_Levi_npbar1000_nw5000.dat" used in Figures 6 and 7.

Random_Growth_FreeEccentricity_Levi_plot.py is a minimal code to plot the sample.
